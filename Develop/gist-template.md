# Matching an HTML Tag || Regex

Welcome, in this tutorial I will be breaking down the regular expression for matching an HTML Tag


/^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/

I know this appears like a cryptic sequence to you, but fear not â€“ we will demystify its components. However, if you're not interested in diving into the world of | Regular Expressions | (or regex), I'd advise clicking the X in the top right of the browser, as this exploration might either bewilder your mind or enhance your coding powers.

## Summary
These expressions stand as a sequence of characters that defines a search pattern.

Behind the comlex look this has `/^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/` regular expressions serve as textual patterns used for either matching or replacing elements within strings of text. I'll break it down in a minute.
It's imperative to note that regex exhibits remarkable flexibility, operating across a spectrum of programming languages. While the showcased regex capably matches HTML tags, it's not the sole approach. The beauty of regex lies in its adaptability and customization.

## Regex Components
okay so lets break down /^<([a-z]+)([^<]+)*(?:>(.*)<\/\1>|\s+\/>)$/

we have '/' that open and close the expression, followed by an anchor '^' and an opening angle bracket '<'.
'([a-z]+)' Matches and captures one or more lowercase alphabetic characters

### Anchors
These expressions are opened and closed with /^ and $/
the ^ and $ represent Anchors. 

### Quantifiers

### OR Operator

### Character Classes

### Flags
